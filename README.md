# Pirate Radio - Official Mod List

This repository serves as the official mod listing for the **Pirate Radio: Client**.

The `mods.json` file in the root of this repository is the central source of truth that the mod loader uses to display and manage available mods. This file is **automatically generated**, so please do not edit it by hand.

## How to Add Your Mod

We welcome all mod creators! To get your mod included in the official list, you must submit a **Pull Request (PR)**.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Fork this Repository:**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy.

2.  **Create Your Mod Metadata File:**

    - In your forked repository, navigate to the `/mods` directory.
    - Create a new JSON file for your mod. The filename should be unique (e.g., `my-awesome-mod.json`).

3.  **Add Your Mod Information:**
    Your new `.json` file must contain all the required metadata for your mod. Please use the following template:

    **Note**: This metadata file can also be generated by the mod creation tool inside `Pirate Radio: Labs`. This is the recommended
    way to create this file as `Pirate Radio: Labs` will make sure its formated correctly and always compliant with the latest specification.
    If you still want to create it by hand please know what you are doing.

    ```json
    {
      "specification": 1,

      "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "name": "Custom Mod",
      "description": "A custom mod for demonstration purposes.",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "authors": ["Your Name"],
      "download": {
        "url": "https://yourwebsite.com/mod.zip",
        "sha256": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
      },
      "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/yourmod",
      "issues": "https://github.com/yourusername/yourmod/issues",
      "tags": ["texture-swap", "misc"],

      "files": [
        {
          "guid": "3d992eb4-99a8ea92-c8c456a1-01d68dd3",
          "source": "player_icon_pumpkin_half_1.png.import",
          "target": "/out/data/mod/icon_pumpkin_half.png.import"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

4.  **Create a Pull Request:**

    - Commit and push your new metadata file to your fork.
    - Go back to this repository and click the "New Pull Request" button.
    - Select your fork's branch as the "compare" branch and the `main` branch of this repository as the "base" branch.
    - Please give your PR a clear title, such as `Add Mod: My Awesome Mod` in addition to a description which briefly outlines what has changed (if you updated the mod) or what the mod does if it is newly added.

5.  **Review:**
    A maintainer will review your submission. Once it's approved and merged, your mod will be included in the `Pirate Radio: Client` shortly after.

> **Warning: Do NOT edit the `mods.json` file directly.**
> Your Pull Request must **only** add or modify a metadata file in the `/mods` directory. PRs that modify `mods.json` will be automatically rejected.

## For Maintainers Only

After merging one or more Pull Requests that add new mods, the central `mods.json` list must be regenerated.

### How to Regenerate `mods.json`

1.  Ensure you have pulled the latest changes from the `main` branch.
2.  Run the generation script:

    ```bash
    pnpx tsx generate-mods-json.ts
    ```

3.  This will scan all files in the `/mods` directory and overwrite the existing `mods.json` with the new, complete list.
4.  Commit and push the updated `mods.json` file directly to the `main` branch.
